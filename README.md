War is a simple card game as old as time typically played by two players using a standard playing card deck. There are many variations of the game, I chose to take the standard version played mostly everywhere. The objective of the game is to win all of the cards. The deck is divided evenly among the players, giving each a down stack. Each player then reveals the top card of their deck and the player with the higher card takes both of the cards played and moves them to their stack. Aces are high and suits are ignored. To unveil the card for your next "battle" simply click inside the box where the decks appear. Click until a winner is declared!
